# Steganography Project

## Overview

This project implements a steganography tool that allows users to hide secret messages within image files. Steganography is the practice of concealing information within another medium to prevent detection. In this case, the tool embeds text data into images without visibly altering the original image.

## Features

- **Hide Messages**: Embed secret text messages into image files.
- **Extract Messages**: Retrieve hidden messages from steganographic images.
- **Supported Formats**: Works with common image formats such as PNG and JPEG.
- **Simple Interface**: Command-line interface for easy integration and use.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **Pillow Library**: This library is used for image processing.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tarunkumar314/Steganography.git
   cd Steganography
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow
   ```

## Usage

The main script, `stego.py`, provides functionalities to encode and decode messages within images.

### Embedding a Message

To embed a secret message into an image:

```bash
python stego.py --encode --input <input_image.png> --output <output_image.png> --message "Your secret message here"
```

- `--encode`: Specifies that you want to embed a message.
- `--input`: Path to the original image file.
- `--output`: Path where the steganographic image will be saved.
- `--message`: The secret text you want to hide.

### Extracting a Message

To extract a hidden message from an image:

```bash
python stego.py --decode --input <stego_image.png>
```

- `--decode`: Specifies that you want to extract a message.
- `--input`: Path to the image containing the hidden message.

## Example

Here's a quick example of how to use the tool:

1. **Hide a Message**:
   ```bash
   python stego.py --encode --input Galaxy_Whirl.jpg --output encryptedImage.jpg --message "Hello, World!"
   ```

2. **Retrieve the Message**:
   ```bash
   python stego.py --decode --input encryptedImage.jpg
   ```

## How It Works

The tool uses the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique to embed the secret message into the image. This method modifies the least significant bit of each pixel's color value, allowing data to be hidden without significantly altering the image's appearance.
